# Method-Of-Characteristics
Python (jupyter notebook) code that can calculate and display minimum length nozzle geometry for a supersonic nozzle. The program takes the following inputs:
  - Target mach number
  - Ratio of specific heats
  - Number of characteristic lines to be used in calculation
  - Start angle of the expansion fan at the nozzle throat.

The function can easily compute up to 100 characteristic lines within a few seconds, but computing time increases rapidly and the program can crash above that.
